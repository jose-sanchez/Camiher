Web Site for the comany CAMIHER.

The web site is developed with MVC 4 .net and jquery. I have created a content manager to allow the user to amend the parrafs in 
the web site and add picture to each parraf

What we can learn 
-Upload images
	Notes: Via iframe tag and input files tag.
	It is possible also to implement a drag and drop functionality described here:
	http://davidwalsh.name/resize-image-canvas
	It will be possible to inplement with a httphandler  or a api service
-Store images in database
-Recover the images from database and Show images in base64
	Notes: After recover the image object it is build a img tag with the base64 image and send to the client via json
		   In the client side jquery process the answer and append the img to the document
-Resize images
	Notes:
		The resize is done via css . Each image returned from the server is whithin a div tag of class imagesmall with a determin size
		From css we set the image to fit 100% of the container div.
		I have tried to resize with a javascript function but as the image are appended in the same call when the resize function
		is execute the image has not been appended still and the resize does not occurr. A posible solution would be to set the image as
		hidden and then  create a timer that call the resize function after a couple of second and toggle it
-Opacity
	notes: If you have a father class with some opacity and you want to have a child without opacity
	you must use background with rgba format for the father  example : background: rgba(27, 25, 25,0.8);
	you cannot use the property opacity because the child will inherate the opacity and you cannot remove it
